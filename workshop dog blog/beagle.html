          The beagle breed is a small scent hound, similar in appearance to the
          much larger foxhound. The beagle was developed primarily for hunting
          hare known as beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell and superior
          tracking instincts, the beagle is the primary breed used as a
          detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in
          quarantine around the world. The beagle is intelligent and is a
          popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited
          health problems. The modern breed was developed in Great Britain
          around the 1830s from several breeds, including the Talbot Hound, the
          North Country Beagle, the Southern Hound, and possibly the Harrier.
          Beagles have been depicted in popular culture since Elizabethan times
          in literature and paintings and more recently in film, television, and
          comic books.
